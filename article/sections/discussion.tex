The results indicate that fine-tuning transformer models on domain-specific assembly-to-C translation tasks yields substantial improvements in decompilation quality. The reduction in Levenshtein distance suggests that our model generates C code that is structurally closer to the ground truth, while the improved BLEU scores indicate better semantic alignment.

\subsection{Limitations}

Several limitations should be noted:
\begin{itemize}
\item The model performance is evaluated on specific compiler optimizations and may not generalize to all optimization levels
\item Limited evaluation on complex control flow structures and advanced C language features
\item Dependency on the quality and diversity of training datasets
\end{itemize}
