# Assembly Dataset Analysis

## Introduction

This document analyzes a dataset of assembly code compilations across different compiler configurations. Based on pattern analysis of the dataset, we provide recommendations for researchers focusing on assembly code analysis.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains C functions compiled with GCC across different optimization levels and architectures. Each entry typically includes the original C code, assembly outputs, and test cases with input/output pairs.

## Compiler Configuration Patterns

Analysis of the dataset reveals the following distinct compiler configuration patterns:

| Pattern ID | Configuration Pattern | Entry Count | Description |
|------------|------------------------|------------|-------------|
| 1 | ('gcc-64-0', 'gcc-64-3', 'gcc-64-s', 'gcc-64-0', 'gcc-64-3', 'gcc-64-s') | 35,388 | Standard pattern: x86-64 and ARM architectures with O0, O3, Os optimizations |
| 2 | ('gcc-64-0', 'gcc-64-3', 'gcc-64-s', 'gcc-64-0', 'gcc-64-3', 'gcc-64-s', 'gcc-64-0', 'gcc-64-3', 'gcc-64-s', 'gcc-64-0', 'gcc-64-3', 'gcc-64-s') | 6,340 | Extended pattern with 4 architecture variants |
| 3 | () | 550 | Empty entries with no assembly code |
| 4 | ('gcc-64-0', 'gcc-64-3', 'gcc-64-s') | 272 | Single architecture with all optimization levels |
| 5 | ('gcc-64-0', 'gcc-64-3', 'gcc-64-s', 'gcc-64-0', 'gcc-64-3', 'gcc-64-s', 'gcc-64-0', 'gcc-64-3', 'gcc-64-s') | 111 | Three architecture variants |
| 6 | ('gcc-64-3', 'gcc-64-s', 'gcc-64-0', 'gcc-64-3', 'gcc-64-s') | 91 | Partial entries (missing first O0 optimization) |
| 7 | ('gcc-64-0', 'gcc-64-0') | 13 | Only O0 optimization for two architectures |
| 8 | ('gcc-64-0', 'gcc-64-3', 'gcc-64-s', 'gcc-64-0', 'gcc-64-3', 'gcc-64-s', 'gcc-64-0', 'gcc-64-0') | 4 | Non-standard mixed pattern |

## Assembly Code Characteristics

The standard pattern (Pattern 1) follows this structure:
- First set: x86-64 architecture with O0, O3, Os optimizations
- Second set: ARM architecture with O0, O3, Os optimizations

### Optimization Levels
- **O0**: No optimization, preserves debugging information
- **O3**: Maximum optimization for speed
- **Os**: Optimization for code size

### Architecture Differences
- **x86-64 Code**: Uses register notation like `%rbp`, `%rsp`, `%rdi`, and registers stack frames differently
- **ARM Code**: Uses registers like `sp`, `x0`, `w1` with different memory access patterns

## Recommendations for Analysis


### 1. Primary Dataset Selection
**Recommendation**: Focus on the x86-64 architecture with O0 optimization level.

**Rationale**:
- **Prevalence**: Present in 42,219 entries (from Patterns 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8)
- **Readability**: Unoptimized (O0) code preserves the most information about the original function logic
- **Instruction Clarity**: x86-64 assembly is widely documented and studied
- **Consistency**: The x86-64 O0 configuration has the most consistent presence across patterns

### 2. Data Cleaning Steps
1. **Remove Pattern 3** (550 empty entries)
2. **Extract the first assembly code set** (`gcc-64-0`) from each entry
3. **Standardize metadata** for consistent processing

### 3. Alternative Approaches
- If comparing optimization effects is important, consider keeping all three optimization levels (O0, O3, Os) for x86-64
- If specific to embedded systems, the ARM configurations could be preferred

### 4. Advanced Analysis Opportunities
With the selected x86-64 O0 assembly code:
- Function signature analysis
- Control flow graph extraction
- Instruction pattern categorization
- Memory access pattern identification
